# Low-cost-DAQ-system
We have developed an economical system for monitoring environmental and thermophysical attributes of a ventilated window situated within a climate simulator. This system employs a Raspberry Pi as its central host and utilizes over 30 cost-effective digital and analog sensors. Among these are models such as the BME280 for temperature, humidity and atmospheric measurements, the SHT31D for precise humidity and temperature readings, the SCD30 for carbon dioxide detection, the TSL2591 and SI1145 for light sensing, the BH1750 for ambient light monitoring, and the MCP9808 and TMP117 for high-accuracy temperature readings. Additionally, the HFP01 is used for heat flux measurement, while the SDP810-125Pa and SDP610-25Pa are incorporated for differential pressure measurements.
